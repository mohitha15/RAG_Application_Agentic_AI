##  Overview

Agentic RAG is a modular RAG pipeline that empowers your application to:

1. **Load documents** (e.g. PDFs or text files).
2. **Chunk content** into meaningful segments.
3. **Generate embeddings** using Google Gemini.
4. **Store and query** content with FAISS.
5. **Answer user questions** via a context-aware LLM (Gemini chat model).
