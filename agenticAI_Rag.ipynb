With an area of about \\n3.28 million square kilometers, it is the seventh-largest country in the world. \\n \\nClimate: Ranges from tropical monsoon in the south to temperate and alpine in the north. \\n \\nRivers: Ganga, Yamuna, Brahmaputra, Godavari, Narmada, and Krishna form the backbone of Indian \\nagriculture and culture. \\n \\nMountains: The Himalayas in the north act as natural barriers and are home to some of the world’s \\ntallest peaks. \\n \\nIndia has a population of more than 1.4 billion people (as of 2023–25), making it the most populous \\ncountry on Earth.

Historical Background \\nAncient India\\n\\nofficially recognized languages, and hundreds of dialects. \\n \\n2. Historical Background \\nAncient India \\n \\nThe Indus Valley Civilization (3300–1300 BCE) was one of the world’s earliest urban cultures, known for \\nits planned cities like Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa. \\n \\nThe Vedic Period gave rise to Hinduism, with scriptures such as the Vedas, Upanishads, and epics like the \\nMahabharata and Ramayana shaping cultural identity. \\n \\nClassical and Medieval India \\n \\nPowerful empires like the Maurya Empire (Chandragupta Maurya, Ashoka the Great) and Gupta Empire \\n(the \"Golden Age\" of science, art, and literature) expanded India’s global influence.\\n\\nIndia is divided into 28 states and 8 union territories, each with its own government. The political system \\nis vibrant, with numerous parties, but dominated by major ones like the Indian National Congress (INC) \\nand the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). \\n \\n4. Economy of India \\n \\nIndia is the fifth-largest economy in the world (by nominal GDP) and the third-largest by purchasing \\npower parity (PPP). \\n \\nAgriculture: Once the backbone of the economy, it still employs around 40% of the population.
